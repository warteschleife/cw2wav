# The 'default' entry should always be present. As its name tells, it is used
# when no other configuration is selected.
#
# 'frequency':     Frequency of the tone in Hz. It can be an integer or two
#                  integers separated by '-' in the form "XXX-YYY". Then, the
#                  actual frequency is chosen randomly in the range from XXX
#                  and YYY
#
# 'len_dit':       Length of a 'dit' in seconds.
#
# 'character_gap': Length of the gap between characters in seconds. If this
#                  parameter is missing, 3 x len_dit is applied.
#
# 'cw_table':      File that contains the CW-code table.
#
# 'base':          This field is optional and defines another configuration
#                  where those parameters should be looked up, that are not
#                  given in the current configuration. So, it is possible to
#                  derive a configuration from another.
